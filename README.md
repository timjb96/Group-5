## Purpose of Study
For our final project, our group will be investigating twitter usage in Congress. Specifically we wish to use Machine Learning to determine if a model can be generated to accurately predict the change in Social Media usage (focusing on Twitter) in Congress over time. We will use data from the first years of Twitter's existence to train a model to predict the increase in usage per candidates in later years. 

Along with the generation of a predictive model that can be used to analyze social media usage changes of other applications besides Twitter, we aim to also create visualizations that demonstrate the different demographics among Congressional Twitter users, and how the presence of a twitter account can affect re-election.
